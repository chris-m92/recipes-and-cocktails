## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425&deg;.

1. Place potatoes in a large saucepan; add water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook, uncovered, until tender (15 - 20 minutes). Drain and return to pan.
1. Squeeze softened garlic onto potatoes; add butter, sour cream, cheese, milk, salt, pepper, and onion. Beat until mashed.
