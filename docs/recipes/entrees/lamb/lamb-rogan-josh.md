## Ingredients
### Dairy
- [ ] 1/2 Cup Full-Fat Greek Yogurt (lemon juice & 1/4 cup water for dairy free)

### Produce
- [ ] 1 Red Onion, diced
- [ ] 3 Cloves Minced Garlic
- [ ] 2 teaspoons Minced Ginger
- [ ] 1 tablespoon Tomato Paste

### Spices
- [ ] 1/4 cup Cilantro, chopped
- [ ] 2 teaspoons Garam Masala
- [ ] 1 teaspoon Smoked Paprika
- [ ] 1-2 teaspoons Kosher Salt
- [ ] 1 teaspoon Turmeric
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon Ground Cinnamon
- [ ] 1/4 - 1 teaspoon Cayenne Pepper
- [ ] 1 Bay Leaf

## Directions
1. Mix everything together in a bowl. If you have time to marinate for an hour or eight, do it, otherwise, just cook.
1. Put the mixture into the Instant Pot.
1. Cook at 15 minutes at High Pressure. Let it release naturally for 10 minutes and then release remaining pressure.

## Notes
1. Don't need the 1/4 cup water
1. Marinate the lamb for at least 30 minutes if you can. This really helps to tenderize the meat and make a wonderful lamb curry.
1. You can use lamb, goat, beef, or chicken to make rogan josh. While not traditional, it is still delicious.
1. If you have an 8-quart, you may need to double the recipe.
1. Make sure to spread the lamb all over the bottom of the Instant Pot. Although I list the water in this recipe as optional, if you're not sure about the quality of the meat you are using, use the water the first time.
1. This recipe works well for meal prep as you can marinate the lamb for a day or two before cooking.
1. You can also mix up the lamb in the marinade, put into a zip top bag, and freeze. When ready to cook, pour 1/4 cup water into the bottom of the instant pot, add the frozen lamb and marinade, and cook as directed. You do not need to increase cook time.
