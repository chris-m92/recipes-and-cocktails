## Ingredients
### Cooking
- [ ] 1 14 ounce can of tomatoes
- [ ] 5 - 6 cloves garlic
- [ ] 1 - 2 teaspoons minced ginger
- [ ] 1 teaspoon tumeric
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
- [ ] 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- [ ] 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- [ ] 1 teaspoon garam masala
- [ ] 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- [ ] 1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs (or use breast, bone-in, or whatever works for you. If frozen, add 1-2 minutes to total time)

### Finishing
- [ ] 4 ounces butter cut into cubes (use coconut oil if dairy free)
- [ ] 4 ounces heavy cream (use full fat coconut milk if dairy free)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon garam masala
- [ ] 1/4 - 1/2 cup chopped cilantro

## Instructions
### Instant Pot Instructions
1. Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the butter, cream, and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it's frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better
1. Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure
1. Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside
1. Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender
1. Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated
1. It's best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding it  into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
1. Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days
1. Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you need but don't shred it
1. Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles

### Using Leftover Sauce
1. Use leftover cooked chicken and mix in with the gently heated sauce, let it simmer for a few for the flavors to meld together and there you go. Add some fresh cilantro on top
1. You could also use this for Paneer Makhani. Defrost a cup of peas and 1 cup of paneer and mix gently into the heated sauce and let it simmer for a few for the flavors to meld together and there you go

### Tips
* If you use a stand blender, be very careful with the hot sauce and be sure to leave the inside lid open to vent
* Yes, I know the recipe doesn't call for additional liquid. The chicken and tonatoes release a lot of liquid. Unless you do something wrong, it will not burn
* Do not re-pressure cook the butter and cream filled sauce for a second time as it gets thin and unappetizing. Cook the chicken when you first make the sauce, save half the tomato sauce frozen, and when you're ready, add cooked chicken, or paneer, and heat it through in a skillet
* For this recipe, the garam masala is very, very, important. Unlike other recipes, I didn't use whole spiced because I've learned that not everyone has whole cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and green cardamom lying around. So we'll use garam masala instead and I must urge you to make this [homemade garam masala recipe](https://twosleevers.com/home-made-garam-masala-recipe/)! It makes a HUGE difference
* You'll note there's no added water in this recipe. Between the tomatoes and the chicken, there's more than enough to create pressure in this recipe. Any more water and it's going to taste insipid
* Let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding it to the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
