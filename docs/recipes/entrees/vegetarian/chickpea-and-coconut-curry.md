## Ingredients
* Olive oil
* Kosher salt
* Black pepper
* 4 Ounces Snow peas
* 1 Sweet potato
* 1/8 Ounce Cilantro
* 1 Lime
* 1 Yellow onion
* 2 Cloves Garlic
* 1 Can Chickpeas
* 2 Tablespoons Coconut flakes
* 7 Ounces Rice noodles
* 1 Vegetable Bouillon cube
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons Tikka masala curry paste
* 1 Can Coconut milk

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 450&deg;F
1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat
1. Rinse all produce
1. Stack snow peas and thinly slice crosswise
1. Halve sweet potato lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/4 inch half moons
1. Pick cilantro leaves and mince stems
1. Cut lime into wedges for serving
1. Peel onion, halve, and thinly slice
1. Mince garlic
1. Drain and rinse chickpeas
1. Line a baking sheet with foil
1. On the prepared sheet, toss sweet potato with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper as desired
1. Arrange in a single layer and roast until tender, 16-18 minutes
1. While sweet potatoes roast, place coconut flakes in a separate medium pot (big enough for the broth) over medium-high heat. Toast, stirring frequently, until golden, 3-5 minutes
1. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside until ready to serve
1. Reserve pot, off heat, for broth
1. Add rice noodles to pot of boiling water, then immediately remove from heat
1. Gently stir to separate noodles and keep from sticking
1. Set aside to soak until tender, about 9 minutes (move on to the broth but don't forget to come back!)
1. Drain noodles and immediately rinse under cold water for 30 seconds to stop cooking - this prevents the noodles from releasing too much starch and turning gummy, set aside
1. While noodles soak, return pot from coconut flakes to medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon olive oil
1. When oil is shimmering, add onion and cook until softened, 5 minutes
1. Add bouillon cube, tikka masala curry paste, and garlic; cook, stiring, until fragrant, 2 minutes
1. Stir in coconut milk and 2 cups water
1. Bring to a boil over high heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until broth is reduced by 1/3 and flavors have melded, 4-5 minutes more
1. Once broth has reduced, stir in snow peas, cilantro stems, and chickpeas
1. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt
1. Divide noodles between bowls and top with roasted sweet potatoes, then ladle broth into bowls
1. Garnish with cilantro leaves and toasted coconut flakes
1. Serve with lime wedges and enjoy!

## Recipe Tips
* Be sure to read through the entire recipe before you begin cooking
* Kitchen time-saver: Slice all the snow peas together! Stack them, then cut crosswise into thin slices
* Coconut milk solids naturally separate from the liquids during transit, but come together during cooking. Vigorously shake the can before opening, or pierce the solids with a spoon before pouring into the pan to avoid a messy splatter
