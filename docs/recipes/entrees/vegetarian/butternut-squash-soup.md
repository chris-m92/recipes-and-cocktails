## Notes
* For extra flavor, I recommend sauteing the garlic and onion before adding the remaining ingredients. Just heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium high heat. Add diced onion and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Then add minced garlic and saute for 1-2 additional minutes until fragrant, stirring occasionally. Then add the remaining ingredients and continue on with the recipe.
