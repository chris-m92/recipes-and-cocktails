## Ingredients
* 9 ounces Ravioli
* 1 clove Garlic, minced
* 0.25 cup Walnuts, chopped
* 4 tablespoons Butter
* 0.5 teaspoon Sage, dried
* 0.25 pound Fresh Spinach
* 1 tablespoon Parmesan, grated
* Salt and Pepper, to taste

## Instructions
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil for the ravioli
1. Once boiling, add the ravioli and cook until tender (check package for specific cooking times, as this can vary with the ravioli size or whether it is fresh or dried)
1. Once cooked, reserve 0.25 cup of the cooking water, then drain the ravioli in a colander
1. While the ravioli is cooking, prepare the rest of the dish
1. Mince the garlic and chop the walnuts before you begin the sage brown butter sauce, since the sauce cooks very quickly
1. Add the butter to a large skillet and melt it over medium-low heat, stirring continuously
1. Once the butter begins to sizzle and becomes foamy (about 2-3 minutes), add the minced garlic and chopped walnuts
1. Continue to stir and cook over medium-low heat until the sediment in the skillet turns deep golden brown (about 3-5 minutes)
1. Once it becomes browned, remove it from the heat, and stir in the dried sage
1. Add the spinach and the 0.25 cup reserved ravioli cooking water to the skillet
1. Return the skillet to low heat
1. Stir until the spinach is wilted (about 2 minutes)
1. Taste the spinach and add salt to taste
1. Finally, add the cooked and drained ravioli to the skillet with the spinach and sage brown butter sauce
1. Toss to coat
1. Serve the ravioli with a light dusting of grated Parmesan and freshly cracked pepper over top
