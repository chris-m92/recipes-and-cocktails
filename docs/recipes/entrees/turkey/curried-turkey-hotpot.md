## Ingredients
* Olive Oil
* Salt
* Black pepper
* 1 Russet Potato
* 6 Ounces Carrots
* 1/8 Ounce Parsley
* 1 Yellow onion
* 1 Chicken bouillon cube
* 12 Ounces Ground turkey
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons Tikka masala curry paste
* 1/3 Cup Peas
* 1 Gala apple
* 1 Tablespoon Apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 Ounce Apricot Preserves
* 1 Parchment Paper

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 450&deg;F
1. Rinse all produce
1. Cut potato crosswise into thin rounds
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper
1. On prepared sheet, toss potato slices with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper as desired
1. Arrange in a single layer and roast, flipping halfway through until lightly browned, 15-20 minutes
1. While potato roasts, halve carrots lengthwise, then cut crosswise on a diagonal into 1/2 inch pieces
1. Finely chop parsley leaves and stems (the stems are actually quite tender, so we've kept them for even more flavor and aroma)
1. Peel onion and cut into small dice
1. In a small bowl, combine chicken bouillon cube and 1 cup water
1. Using a fork, gently mash to disolve cube and set aside
1. Heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a medium high-sided ovenproof pan over medium high heat
1. When oil is shimmering, add carrots and onion; saute, stirring until softened, 4-5 minutes
1. Add turkey to pan and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper as desired
1. Cook, breaking up turkey, until browned, about 5 minutes
1. Add tikka masala curry paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 2 minutes
1. Stir in broth to combine
1. Increase heat under pan with turkey to high and bring to a boil; cook, stirring, to warm through, 2-3 minutes more
1. Remove pan from heat and stir in peas
1. Once baked, using tongs or a fork, carefully arrange potato slices over turkey in pan so they overlap slightly
1. Transfer to oven and bake until potatoes are brown and crisp and flavors have melded, 10-15 minutes
1. While hotpot bakes, peel apple, slice off rounded sides, and cut into small dice, discarding core
1. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a small pot over medium-high heat
1. When oil is shimmering, add apple; saute, stirring, until beginning to soften, 3-4 minutes
1. Stir in apple cider vinegar, apricot preserves, and 1/4 cup water. Cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, 3-5 minutes more
1. Remove pot from heat and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt
1. Divide turkey hotpot between serving plates, or bring straight to the table. Top with apple chutney, garnish with parsley, and dig in!

## Recipe Tips
* Be sure to read through the entire recipe before you begin cooking
* Feel free to slice the carrots as usual. We like to cut them on a diagonal, also known as the bias cut, for a cheffy touch and elegant presentation
* The potato slices create a lid on the turkey hotpot so it doesn't lose too much moisture as it bakes. Try overlapping them slightly to create a spiral shape. USDA recommends cooking ground turkey to 165&deg;F
