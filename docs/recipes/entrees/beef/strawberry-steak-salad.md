## Ingredients
### For the salad
- [ ] 10 - 12 ounce sirloin steak
- [ ] Olive oil or avocado oil (as needed)
- [ ] Salt and paper (to taste)
- [ ] 4 - 6 ounce looseleaf lettuce (washed and chopped)
- [ ] 8 - 10 ounce fresh strawberries (as many as wanted)
- [ ] 1 large avocado
- [ ] 2 - 3 teaspoon sweet balsamic glaze (optional but delicious!)

### For the dressing
- [ ] 1/4 cup quality extra virgin olive oil
- [ ] 2/3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (extra to taste)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- [ ] 1 tablespoon dijon mustart
- [ ] 1 teaspoon honey
- [ ] 1 clove garlic (smashed and minced)
- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions
1. Pre-heat oven to 425&deg;F
1. Pat steaks dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides. For best results, allow steak to come to room temperature before cooking
1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat
1. Add to pan and sear until browned, approximately 2 minutes for the first side and 1 minute for the second side
1. Using a potholder, place skillet, steaks and all, in the oven for 2-3 minutes, or until desired internal temperature is reached. If using steaks larger than 6 ounces each, adjust times as needed
1. Remove from oven and place steaks on a plate. Cover with foil and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes. Resting is crucial for a juicy steak and gives us ample time to make our salad and dressing
1. Chop your lettuce, strawberries, and avocado. Drizzle avocado with lime juice and/or oil to keep things gorgeously green
1. Combine dressing ingredients in a mason jar and shake well. Feel free to adjust levels of balsamic and honey to taste. The above measurements are my dream combo!
1. Once rested, thinly slice your steak into bite-sized pieces. Toss together greens, berries, and avocado then top with your steak. Drizzle with a little of the dressing and dive in!
