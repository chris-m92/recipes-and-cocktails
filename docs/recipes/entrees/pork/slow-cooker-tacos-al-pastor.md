### For Slow Cooker Pulled Pork
1. Combine the enchilada sauce, brown sugar, coriander, and cumin. Stir to mix well and pour into the base of a slow cooker

1. Combine the lime juice and pineapple juice and pour over the pork in the slow cooker. Top with the onions and garlic. Gently spoon the sauce over the onions and galic and stir them into the sauce, mixing in the lime and pineapple juices to fully mix together
1. Turn the pork one last time and cook in the slow cooker for 4-6 hours on high, or 8 hours on low
