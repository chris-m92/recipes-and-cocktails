## Recipe Tips
* Be sure to read through the entire recipe before you begin cooking
* Kitchen time-saver: stack picked basil leaves, roll the stack up, then cut the roll crosswise into thin slices. From there, it's easy to finely chop the basil all at once
* Burrata is a very delicate cheese, so try to handle gently. Since it is filled with a soft cream, discard only the watery liquid from the container and not any cheese solids
* USDA recommends cooking pork sausage to 160&deg;F
