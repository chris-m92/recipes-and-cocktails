* 3 Ancho Chiles, seeds removed
* 3 Dried Guajillo Chiles, seeds removed
* 3 Pasilla Chiles, seeds removed
* 6 Red Jalapenos or Fresno Chiles, halved, seeds removed
* 6 Garlic Cloves
* 4 Corn Tortillas, plus more, warmed, for serving
* 1 teaspoon Mexican or Italian Oregano
* 0.5 teaspoon Cumin Seeds
* 3 Whole Cloves
* 1 teaspoon Allspice Berries
* 2 cups Fresh Orange Juice

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 500&deg;. Roast cascabel, ancho, guajillo, and pasilla chiles on a rimmed baking sheet until completely blackened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and pour in cold water to cover; let sit 30 minutes to soften. Drain
1. Meanwhile, roast jalapenos, garlic, and 4 tortillas on a clean rimmed baking sheet until blackened and charred, 12-15 minutes
1. Heat a dry small skillet over medium-high and toast oregano and cumin seeds, tossing often, until beginning to burn, about 1 minute. Transfer oregano and cumin to a small bowl. Char cloves and allspice, tossing often, until black and ashy, about 4 minutes
1. Puree softened chiles, tortillas, jalapenos, garlic, oregano, cumin seeds, cloves, allspice, orange juice, and salt in a blender until smooth. Place pork in a large bowl and pour adobo over (meat should be submerged). Cover and chill at least 6 hours and up to 12 hours
1. Remove pork from adobo, leaving as much paste on meat as possible, and let sit at room temperature 1 hour
1. Prepare a grill for medium-low heat. Grill pork, turning once after first 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 145&deg;, 35-45 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes before thinly slicing
1. Serve pork with tortillas, guacamole, Grilled Salsa Roja, Avocado-Tomatillo Salsa Verde, and lime wedges
