## Ingredients
### Marinating and Cooking
* 1 pound boneless pork shoulder (cut into short 1/4 - 1/2 inch slices)
* 1 onion (sliced thin)
* 1 tablespoon minced ginger
* 1 tablespoon minced garlic
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon rice wine
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 2 packets splenda
* 2 tablespoons gochujang
* 1/4 - 1 teaspoon gochugaru
* 1/4 cup water

### Finishing
* 1 sliced onion
* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
* 1/4 cup chopped green scallions

## Instructions
1. In the inner liner of your Instant Pot or pressure cooker, mix up all the marinating and cooking ingredients. Allow this to sit for at least an hour if possible, and up to 24 hours if you need to
1. Cook at high pressure for 20 minutes and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. When 10 minutes are up, release all remaining pressure
1. When you open the pot, you will see the well-cooked meat and some very yummy-looking sauce
1. Heat up a wide cast iron pan or some other pan that will get very hot
1. To this hot pan, add the pork cubes, and the thinly sliced onion
1. Let this get hot and then pour in 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the sauce. If you have the heat up high enough this sauce will start to sizzle and caramelize quickly. Mix well with the pork
1. You're trying to get this sauce to evaporate, leaving behind its tasty goodness onto the meat
1. Once the sauce has evaporated and the onions have softened, sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions, and serve
1. You can use the rest of the sauce from your pressure cooker to serve on the side

## Substitutes
* If you do not eat pork, use beef sirloin or chicken thighs. For chicken, leave the thighs whole, cook for 10 minutes under pressure and then cut up later
* There is no substitute for gochujang in this recipe. If you buy it however, I have several gochujang recipes that use this tasty goodness. It keeps well for months in the refrigerator
* If you are GF, use this brand of GF gojuchang, as some varieties do contain wheat
* You can substitute 1 tablespoon of agave nectar or honey for the splenda
