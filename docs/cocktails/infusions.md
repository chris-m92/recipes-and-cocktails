# Infusions

!!! menu-book "Death & Co. Page 278"

When making your own infusions, here are a few pointers:

`Solvent`
:   Infusions get a bad rap becuase of cheap vodka and artificially flavored candy. But when you start with top-shelf booze, you can give an already-delicious product an added layer of complexity. High proof spirits make for a speedier infusion process, sometimes only a matter of minutes, while vermouth and other lower-proof booze may take up to a week to accomplish the task.

`Flavorings`
:   We love infusing with fancy, one-of-a-kind tea blends and ingredients typically found in sweet liqueurs, such as coffee, coconut, and pineapple. Fruit and any other fresh produce should be unblemished and washed before use. Surface area is important: we use loose tea and finely chopped produce to allow more contact with the solvent. This speeds the process and results in a more flavorful infusion.

`Vessel`
:   Choose a nonreactive plastic or glass container with a tight lid, and be sure you can fit a spoon into it for stirring. Restaurant-grade Cambro containers are excellent, as are wide-mouthed jars. It's absolutely essential that the vessel be very clean, as alcohol will suck up the flavor of chicken soup or whatever was last in the container, even dish soap. Be sure to save the original booze bottle for storing the infusion when it's complete.

`Temperature`
:   Most single-ingredients infusions can be made at room temperature in a cool, dark place. If using a variety of ingredients that will infuse at different rates, such as fresh fruit along with spices, refrigerate the infusion to give the flavors more time to meld.

`Time`
:   The duration required to make a flavorful infusion can vary dramatically based on many factors: the intensity or ripeness of the ingredients, the size of the vessel, and, most importantly, your own preference. When making infusions, taste them frequently. Fresh, ripe ingredients, such as berries and tropical fruits, will infuse rather quickly, and it's important to strain them out before the fruit deteriorates too much - but not before it's given all of its flavor to the spirit. Anything involving tannins (say tea or herbs) is even less forgiving; there's a fine line between the perfect level of Earl Grey flavor in vermouth and an overly tannic mess. Dry, hard ingredients, such as pecans, require a bit more time - sometimes more than a week - to impart their flavor.

`Storage`
:   Although infusions may be shelf stable in a cool, dark place, we recommend refrigerating them to help keep their flavors fresh longer. As a bonus, your infusions will be prechilled when you make cocktails.
