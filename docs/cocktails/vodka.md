!!! local-bar "Glass/Ice"
    * Collins Glass
    * Cubed Ice

!!! abstract "Ingredients"
    * 2 oz Vodka
    * 3/4 oz Citrus Green Tea-Grapefruit Syrup
    * 3/4 oz Lime Juice
    * 2 dashes Rose Water
    * 1 1/2 oz Aromatic Tonic Water

!!! example "Instructions"
    1. Add the vodka, syrup, lime juice, and rose water to a shaker. Fill the shaker with ice cubes and shake vigorously until it is ice-cold and shows frost on the outside (15-30 seconds).
    1. Strain the shaker's contents into a collins glass over fresh cubed ice, then top with about 1 1/2 oz of tonic water - we recommend using your bar spoon to force the carbonation all the way down to the bottom of the glass (check out [shakerandspoon.com/techniques](https://shakerandspoon.com/techniques) "The Humble Bar Spoon," for help with this trick). Place the spoon, standing straight up, down into the center of the glass. Place the mouth of the tonic water bottle (or the jigger) near the top of the handle, right at the edge of the spoon, and pour, letting the tonic water spiral down the handle all the way to the bottom of the glass.
