!!! success "Love it!"

!!! local-bar "Glass/Ice"
    * Collins Glass
    * Cubed Ice

!!! abstract "Ingredients"
    * 2 oz Bourbon
    * 3/4 oz Arabic Tea Syrup
    * 3/4 oz Lemon Juice
    * 2 dashes Jerry Thomas Decanter Bitters
    * 2 oz Ginger Beer
    ---
    * 1 Star Anise Pod

!!! example "Instructions"
    1. Add the bourbon, syrup, lemon juice, and bitters to a shaker. Fill the shaker with ice cubes and shake vigorously until it is ice-cold and shows frost on the outside (15-30 seconds).
    1. Strain the shaker's contents into a collins glass over fresh cubed ice, then top with the ginger beer - we recommend using your bar spoon to force the carbonation all the way down to the bottom of the glass (check out [shakerandspoon.com/techniques](https://shakerandspoon.com/techniques), "The Humble Bar Spoon," for help with this trick). Place the spoon, standing straight up, down into the center of the glass. Place the mouth of the ginger beer bottle (or the jigger) near the top of the handle right at the edge of the spoon, and pour, letting the ginger beer spiral down the handle all the way to the bottom of the glass
    1. For the finishing touch, float the star anise pod on top of the drink.
