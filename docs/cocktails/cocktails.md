!!! quote "Flips And Fizzes"
    Cocktail historians might take issue with our simplified definition, but for our purposes flips contain a whole egg or yolks alone; fizzes contain a whole egg or whites alone. Either way, the almighty egg adds distinctive body and texture to any drink it touches. As always, heed the standard raw-egg warnings.

!!! quote "Swizzles"
    Swizzles hail from the Caribbean, where they are traditionally mixed with the stem of the *Quararibea turbinata* tree (see page 70). We like to premix the drink by dry shaking or whipping the ingredients with a few ice pellets, which speeds the swizzling process and saves valuable time during service. But if you have the time, feel free to build the cocktail as you would a julep, swizzling the ingredients with a mixing spoon - or a *bois lele* if you're lucky enough to own one.
