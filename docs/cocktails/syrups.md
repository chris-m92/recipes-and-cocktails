## Orgeat

!!! menu-book "Death & Co. Page 278"

!!! note "History"
    Orgeat is an almond-based syrup that has been part of cocktail culture since the mid-nineteenth century. It's a key ingredient in the vintage Japanese Cocktail (brandy, orgeat, and Angostura bitters) and especially the mai tai and its tiki brethren. Made primarily from water and almonds, along with other ingredients such as orange flower water and cognac, it has a unique flavor that's more t han the sum of its ingredients and something altogether individual. It's milky and nutty but not cloying. It deepens the flavors of other ingredients and bridges magically between refreshing and savory, creating an etheral mouthfeel that makes ingredients meld in unexpected ways, and at Death & Co, we use it in many styles of cocktails.
