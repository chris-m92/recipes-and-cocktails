!!! example "Instructions"
    1. If your fridge makes crushed ice, skip to step 2. If not, make enough by hand to fill a rocks glass. Do not use a blender. Fill a Ziploc freezer bag (or Lewis bag) with ice cubes, cover with a towel, then slowly crush the ice with a wooden mallet or other blunt object. Easy does it! You want small shards of ice, not a slushie. Set aside.
    1. Add the St. Germain, syrup, lemon juiice, and 1 makrut lime leaf to a shaker. Fill the shaker with ice cubes and give it a short but hard shake (10-15 seconds). Add the sparkling wine to the shaker.
    1. Double strain the shaker's contents into a collins glass and then fill and top it with crushed ice. Garnish with the other makrut lime leaf.
